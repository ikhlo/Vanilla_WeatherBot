# Chatbot Recommendation Systems - Build a Rule-based Weather Bot

This is an academic project in which we had to create a Weather Bot to answer some simple questions like :
<ul>
    <li>What is the weather in Dublin ?</li>
    <li>How is the weather in Kuala Lumpur ?</li>
    <li>Will it be cloudy in Paris tomorrow ?</li>
    <li>Is it hot in Los Angeles today ?</li>
</ul>

To understand the subject and the instructions, take a look to the [VanillaBot_Instructions](https://github.com/ikhlo/Vanilla_WeatherBot/blob/main/VanillaBot_Instructions.pdf) file.

</br> 

We used the [OpenWeather APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api) to collect our weather informations.
